        <h3 class="title">Ideal Job</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">A job that was listed and piques my interest was Data Scientist at Northbridge Recruitment. The job position requires the employee to do research and implementing data for machine learning algorithms and selection optimisation to improve efficiencies with products. The job also requires employees to do trends and patterns analysis. The part that appeals to me is that I am able to come up with solutions to further improve the machine learning algorithms, I really wants to know more about machine learning and how it would be revolution that will push technologies forward. Also, if I were to get the job, I would be working in groups which allows me to see how other would approach a problem and come up with a solution that is the best fitting for the circumstance and expand my brain so that I am not stuck to the belief that there is only one way to solve a problem. Another reason would also be that the pay is quite generous which appealed to me.

        </p>

        <h3 class="title">Skills, Qualification and experience I have</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">The job requirements state that the PhD/advances degree qualification in data science, mathematics or econometrics are required and some experiences in machine learning algorithms, statistical and quantitative models or analytics applicants are also required. The position also requires the employee to be able to code in Python and other data science packages such as Sklearn, SciPy and others. Some knowledge in SQL/NoSQL database are also required such as MongoDB or Snowflake.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Obtaining These Skills</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">I am currently undergoing the first year of Bachelor or Information Technology, the courses that I am enrolled in are currently teaching python, SQL and other necessary skills that are required for the job position. By paying attention in class and doing extra works and research outside of class, I can learn more specific requirements and how to acquire the skills that allow me to get the job. One of the requirements to have a PhD in data science, mathematics or econometrics, in order to meet this requirement, I may have to do another course in order to get the PhD for data science or mathematics. It also expects the person apply for the job to have an extent knowledge in machine learning, in order to gain the knowledge of machine learning, in my third year on Bachelor of Information Technology I would have to pick the course “Machine Learning” as one of my courses so that I would have some insight in machine learning algorithms which enable me to meet the specific condition to get the job.</p>
