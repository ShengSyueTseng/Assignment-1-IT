        <h3 class="title">Personal Information</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">Welcome to my profile. My name is Sheng-Syue Tseng or you can call me Sean. My student number is s3939810 and my student email address is s3939810@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Background Information</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">I am currently doing my first year of Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University in Australia. I am half Taiwanese and half Cantonese who was born in Vietnam now undergoing education in Australia. I first arrived in Australia in 2018 when I was 14 years old. I've recently finished VCE year 12 in 2021 and was able to achieve an ATAR that satisfied me which allowed me to get into Bachelor of Information Technology. An interesting fact about myself is that I am able to speak fluently in 4 languages which consisted of Chinese (Mandarin), Cantonese, Vietnamese and English. I am also interested in the Japanese language and would like to learn more about it and be able to speak Japanese fluently. </p>

        <h3 class="title">Other interest</h2>
    
        <p class="paragraph">My hobbies are games, movies, anime, manga and comics. I started watching anime in year 7 and since then I have watched over 200 anime. I also like building Gundams because I like the sense of building something with my own 2 hands. For games, I mostly play First Person Shooter (FPS) games such as Counter Strike Global Offensives (CSGO) and Overwatch, I have over 700 hours in CSGO and probably 300 hours in Overwatch, other games that I played are Team Fortress 2 and the Pok√©mon franchise which I have also devoted a lot of my time into. </p>
