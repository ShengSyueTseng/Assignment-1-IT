        <h1 class="title">PROJECT IDEA</h1>

        <h3 class="title">Overview</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">My project idea is a check list application that provide exercise tasks on a daily basis. The tasks range from easy to hard and short to long. The application also contains a streak metre to help users to maintain the routine that they will develop while using this application, BMI calculator is also provided for easy and quick access when the users need it. This app mainly targets at users who just wanted to start working out as most of the work outs are simple and requires zero equipment. The end goal of my application is to help maintain motivations for beginners who wants to start working out and motivates them to not give up.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Motivation</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">My motivation for this project was that I want to do some light exercises to stay healthy, I was able to keep the routine consistently but recently I stopped and couldn’t find a way to get back to my routine. Another motivation that made me want to do this project is that it was estimated that over 39% of adults around the world were obese and that nearly 2.8 million people die from this disease each year. In recent year, it was found that 39 million children under the age of 5 are diagnosed with some form of overweight or obesity. If my application is successful, then it can motivate people to start looking after their health and lower the number of obesity and become healthier.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Description</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">This project is to create an application with the main purpose that can motivate and get newer users to start exercising and become healthier. Although people who have been working out for a long time can use this app, generally the application aims mainly at beginners and people who are trying to work out for the first time as the workouts are tasks that can be done at home without requiring specific gym equipment What the application do is essentially a checklist app but instead of chores and reminders, it gives out workout tasks daily for users to complete. The workout exercises can range from easy to do to a bit challenging, this so that users can push themselves and keep challenging themselves to work harder.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Unlike other apps that are on the market, the exercises will be generated randomly each day so that users can do different workouts and not sticking to 1 work out and doing it everyday. After finishing a task, the user can press on it to check it off and continue to the next one, each day will have 7-8 different exercises that users can do and base on the difficulty there can be more or less. The app also has a feature that will keep track of consecutive days the user has exercised; this will be shown as the streak metre. By having a streak metre, this allows the app to motivate the users more because they may want to get a higher streak and see that they are doing well each day. The app also comes included with a BMI calculator so the users can check their own statistic anytime and anywhere to know if they have had made any improvement or not. With the BMI calculator included, users no longer need to download multiple applications or go on a website to figure the number out, not only does this help save users’ time, but it also allows them to constantly see their progress so that they are reminded that they have a goal and pushes them to workout harder or more frequent. Furthermore, the aspect that would made this applications unique and different from any other workout apps on the market would be the achievement feature, the achievement feature has fixed goals that users have to achieve, such as doing exercises continuously for 7 days or doing 1000 push ups in total. In order to push users harder, little achievements like these allows users to have a smaller goals that are more achievable and they can see that they do in fact are making progresses and not wasting time.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Tools and Technologies</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">Dart would be the main programming language that will be used to code and program this application. Dart allows use to code the application as well as enable us to use it open-source software development kit known as Flutter. The app will benefit from using these two tools as Flutter allows the app to be the app to be on both IOS and Android and not restricted to only one, this means that there can be a wider range of users. Flutter is also to be considered as reliable by many which encouraged me to give it a try.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Skills Required</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">The skills that are necessary for this project is to be able to code in Dart and the skills to use Flutter. As of right now, it would be hard for me to program the app, since I am inexperience in coding and program, I would have to learn the necessary skills in order to program the application. To obtain these skills, I would have to watch videos on YouTube and read the documentation from both Dart and Flutter’s website in order to understand how to use these tools to my best so that my project can be successful. </p>

        <h3 class="title">Outcome</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">If the project is successful, the outcome would be an application that motivates its users to work out and exercise. The problem of not being familiar with Flutter and Dart can be solve taking time to read through the documentations and watching videos and asking others who knows a lot about these tools. The impact of this development is that it will create an user friendly app and easy to use app that anyone can use, with features that can drives users to develop a healthy routine of exercising and developing a healthier lifestyle. </p>
