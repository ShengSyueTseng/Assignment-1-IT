        <h3 class="title">My Interest In IT</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">My interest in IT started when my cousin built my first PC. I was fascinated by the fact that building a PC takes a lot of prior knowledges to know which part fit where and if the parts are able to run efficiently without bottlenecking other parts and was told that there were much more that I can learn which made me more curious about the IT field. Another reason that I’m into IT was because I watched a youtuber called Michael Reeves, I like the fact that he can create anything he wants with a combination of engineering and coding to execute his project. I find it very interesting how any ideas that I may come up are possible to do through the use of coding and not just a dream or an idea that cannot be fulfilled. Even though I have some interests in the IT field, I am not good at coding because the subjects that I did in year 12 has nothing to do with coding so I hope that I can improve my coding skills and knowledges about IT.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Reason For RMIT</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">I’ve chosen RMIT because after some research that I did, I found that RMIT is an expert in the information technology field, RMIT is ranked as the 14th university in Australia which means that it has a good reputation which further encouraged my choice to choose RMIT. RMIT is also close to the city which makes traversing to the campus easier than lots of other universities. Unlike most University, RMIT is more hands on rather than just theory which means that I can improve my coding skills and other types of skills faster and better because I am able to use my two hands to experience the work rather than just listen and learn from it.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Expect To Learn</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">What I want to learn from this course are skills that I can apply in my future career. Since I am not very good at coding and still new to the coding field in general, I want to learn more about coding and improving my skills at programming. I also want to learn more about how the internet work such as saving information online, artificial intelligent, security, web computing and much more. I also want to learn more about the new technologies as IT is so vast and is constantly changing so fast, so I want to be up to date with my knowledge so that I can apply it in the future.</p>
